ERROR FREEZE-1A (resolved)





ERROR MTH-1A fixed as of 7-7-2020:
(*Note This is a multi threading error)


Problem with toggleRecording() function and runTimer() function in launcher.py and exp_updater.py where runTimer() is called

Description: The error occurs where the 'self.endRunThread' is being started but then interupted to end prematurely. Further more the boolean values tied to self.recording are sometimes being changed to True
sometimes after the timer already begins which should not happen. 

*Update on Error MTH-1A: There were two threads that were accessing the toggleRecording() function both timer threads, one being self.endRunThread, and one thread being instantiated in startRecordingAtTime function called 'self.startRunThread'
The 'self.startRunThread = threading.Timer(delay, self.toggleRecording)' was being initiated and then self.endRunThread was being initiated afterwords essentially making two threads that would then change the logical value of self.recording indeterminently.
self.recording boolean value was used extensively and because of the threading error it would cause the toggleRecording function to be called multiple times thus at times ending the recording early.





ERROR SYNT-1A fixed as of 7-1-20
